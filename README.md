# GCP CI/CD Pipeline Project - Mostafa Eid ‚òÅÔ∏è


## Project Overview

Welcome to the GCP CI/CD Pipeline Project, where we embark on a journey to optimize Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment using the robust services of Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This project is all about making your software development lifecycle more efficient and reliable.

## Project Components üõ†Ô∏è

### Jenkins CI/CD Pipelines üöÄ
- **Pipeline 1: Infrastructure as Code (IAC) with Terraform on GCP**:
  - Automate the provisioning of GCP resources using Terraform.
  - Set up a secure, resilient, and scalable infrastructure.
  - Enhance security by defining strict access control policies.
  
- **Pipeline 2: Dockerize and Deploy Applications with Kubernetes**:
  - Containerize your applications with Docker for easy deployment.
  - Deploy your applications to a Kubernetes cluster on GCP.
  - Ensure high availability and fault tolerance for your applications.

### Collaboration and Security üåê
- **GitHub Collaboration**:
  - Leverage the power of GitHub for version control and collaboration.
  - Automate your CI/CD pipelines through GitHub actions and webhooks.
  
- **Security Measures**:
  - Implement security best practices at every stage.
  - Ensure controlled access to critical resources.
  - Store your Docker images securely in GCP's Artifact Registry.

### Monitoring and Maintenance üõ†Ô∏è
- **Logging and Monitoring**:
  - Set up logging and monitoring to keep track of your applications and infrastructure.
  - Receive timely alerts in case of issues.

- **Easy Maintenance**:
  - Simplify infrastructure maintenance with Infrastructure as Code.
  - Keep your applications up and running without hassle.

This project is a holistic approach to efficient software delivery, combining Infrastructure as Code, Docker containers, Kubernetes orchestration, and the power of Jenkins for continuous integration and continuous deployment.

## Prerequisites üöÄ

Before you dive into setting up this powerful CI/CD pipeline, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

1. A GCP Account:
   - Access to a Google Cloud Platform account with the necessary permissions.
   - The ability to create and manage GCP resources.

2. Jenkins Server:
   - Jenkins installed and configured on your server.

3. GitHub Repository:
   - A GitHub repository for your project, enabling version control and collaboration.

4. Tools Installed:
   - Terraform for Infrastructure as Code.
   - Docker for containerization.
   - kubectl for Kubernetes operations.
   - Google Cloud SDK for GCP management.

## Getting Started üöÄ

1. **Setting up Infrastructure as Code with Terraform**:

   - Clone the project repository.
   - Configure Jenkins to run the first CI/CD pipeline, linked to the GitHub repository.
   - Trigger the pipeline to provision GCP infrastructure automatically.

2. **Deploying Applications with Kubernetes and Docker**:

   - Once the infrastructure setup is complete, the second CI/CD pipeline will automatically trigger.
   - Dockerize your applications and deploy them to the Kubernetes cluster.

3. **Collaboration and Monitoring**:

   - Leverage GitHub for collaboration and version control.
   - Set up logging and monitoring to ensure the health and performance of your applications.

4. **Maintenance and Security**:

   - Keep your infrastructure and applications up to date using Infrastructure as Code.
   - Implement security measures to control access and protect your resources.
